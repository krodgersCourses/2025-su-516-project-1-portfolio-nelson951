    Hello. My name is Arlene. I am a teacher in a small district. I have been their 29+ years. I have a bachelor’s in music education, a Master in Reading, and a master’s in library science. I currently work at the Jr. Sr. High School teaching Music, Speech, Driver’s Education, and ISAT prep. I also served as the district Media Specialist for many years.
When I am not at school or in the Driver’s Education Car, I can be found working on my small ranch, wrangling an assortment of animals, and irrigating the fields. As you can imagine I am remarkably busy. On the rare occasion I get to recreate, I spend the time hiking in the summer, cross-country skiing, or in my case crashing, in the winter. I also try to carve out time for running and riding horses. The town is small and isolated with immediate access to four mountain ranges. The closest Walmart or MacDonald’s is 150 miles away and the only place to purchase clothing in town is at the Dollar Store.
